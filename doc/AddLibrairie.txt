Here are the instructions for adding a graphics library:
- Create a class that inherits from ILib
- create the setMap function which allows to set a map as a std::vector<std::string>.
- create the getEvent function which returns the keys that are clicked by the user as a lower case std::string. It should also close the window if the "q" key is clicked  
- create the isOpen which returns if the game window is open
- create the setAsset function which must allow to link a character of the map with a png texture
- create the draw function which must display the game.
- create the drawMenu function which must display a menu specific to the graphic library
- You can then add the lib to the CMakeList and you're done!
